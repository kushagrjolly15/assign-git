What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
Gitignore file is a file which adds file extensions for files you would not want to put in source control.
Java project will have below list of files in gitignore:
# Compiled class file
*.class
# Log file
*.log
# BlueJ files
*.ctxt
# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/
# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar
Over time you will want to add other extension as these files live in your working space but are not intended for source control. Otherwise you will get a lot of messages in your git status about having files you haven’t added to the repository. Mostly it happens when you are working in a team based projects.

What does fast-forward in Git mean?
When two branches are merged and get merged without any conflicts that is called fast forward.
Basically a situation where 2 team members might have checked out at the
same time from master and then both worked locally on their own branches.
The first one to merge will have no conflicts and will be a fast forward.

Why should you have different branches?
We need different branches in a project as we would want not to touch the master. The main branch — the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master.
If you make changes to the master branch of a group project while other people are also working on it, your changes will affect everyone else and there will be merge conflicts for everyone too.


In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
For a project we should generally have one Git repository but we can have as many braches as possible.
